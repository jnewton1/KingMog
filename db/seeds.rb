# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Example quotes
#Quote.create(body:"I'll be back", auther: 'Arnold')

#Quote.create(body:"Get to the chopper!!!", auther: 'Arnold')

#Quote.create(body:"Who is your daddy and what does he do?", auther: 'Arnold')
